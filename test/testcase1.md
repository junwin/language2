# Test case

##  Previous conversation:
In general I will not buy or select small cap financial instruments


## Conversation in a new session:
Which of these financial instruments do you think I would consider?


SPZ - small cap no dividends - high growth
IBM - large cap pays dividens - medium growth
AZT - medium cap pays dividends - medium growth

## Response
Based on the information you previously shared with me, it sounds like you would not consider SPZ, 
the small cap financial instrument, due to the high risk involved. However, you may be interested 
in IBM or AZT, which are large and medium cap respectively, and both offer dividends. 

The fact that IBM is a large cap stock may be appealing since it often signifies a well-established 
company with a stable track record, and its medium growth rate could offer a good balance of 
potential returns with minimized risk. 

Alternatively, AZT may also be worth considering since 
it's a medium cap stock with moderate growth and provides dividends which can offer passive income. 
Ultimately, the decision on which financial instrument to choose will depend on your financial goals and risk tolerance.

## When using semantic distancing to select previous conversation

## Response
Based on the information you provided, it seems like you might consider investing in IBM - a large cap stock that pays dividends and has medium growth potential. This is because you seem to prefer investing in larger, more established companies (such as IBM) and dividends provide a steady source of income from your investments. Additionally, since you are not interested in small cap stocks or those that do not pay dividends, the other options you presented (SPZ and AZT) may not be the best fit for your investment strategy.
